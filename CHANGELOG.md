    - New punish attack that has a chance to activate while punishing smaller enemies. Functionally the same as the stomp punish attack
    - New spawn state based on her spawn anim in Smash Bros.
    - M2 Tweeks:
        - Heel slide and ABK down are now jump-cancellable
        - Jump-cancellable moves now properly check to see if Bayo has any mid-air jumps remaining
        - Heel slide can now be directionally influenced mid-slide

     - Fixed bug that allowed Bayonetta to keep looping punish attacks on the same downed enemy
- 0.4.1
    - Now doing the skindef optimization thingy
    - The punish prompt when getting close to an enemy no longer appears if Bayonetta is in the middle of another skill
        - Having the prompt appear in this scenario lead to a bug that allowed Bayonetta to infinatley activate interactable items such as fireworks
        - I will add a more elegant way of alerting the player when an enemy is punishable eventually
    - ABK's shooting state (state from holding m2 down after ABK) has been adjusted in order to flow better:
        - The shooting state itself has been shortened, but Bayonetta will now shoot during the main ABK state as long as the m2 button is held down
        - The bullets from the shooting state now juggle nearby enemies
    - Bayonetta's guns are now hidden during some of her taunts
- 0.4.0
    - Added VFX :D
    - Updated model - this is to make it easier in the future for skin creation, but this should also help improve performance

    - Increased the hitbox size for heel tornado, breakdance, and death drop
    - ABK's aniamation is now angled based on the direction aimed when activating the skill
    - The 'Strut' emote now automatically moves bayonetta forward
    - Starting to add new vfx, including a rose effect for when bayo takes damage and a ground break effect for death drop
    - Changed item interaction with brainstalks, the braintalks buff will now only just remove all instance of WT cooldown when activated
    - Changed damage values:
        - Bullet arts punches: 300% -> 200%
            - Did you know that the first four punches of bullet arts were dealing twice the amount of damage that was listed in the skill def? Because I didn't
        - Bullet arts flurry attack: 135% -> 165%
        - Breakdance: 150% -> 120%
        - Heel Tornado: 200% -> 150%
        - Full Moon Shoot finisher: 125% -> 100%
            - These m2 nerfs look like a lot but now that the bullets deal non trivial, consistent damage, the overall m2 damage output should be better
