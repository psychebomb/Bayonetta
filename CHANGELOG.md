    - Added new version of LDB taunt that uses camera animations. On alpha3 by default, LDB w/o camera anims is still on alpha4 and strut emote has been moved to alpha5
    - Fixed LDB taunt causing Bayo 1's sleeves to look weird
    - Added a new song for Bayo's strut emote that plays by default. The old one can still be turned on in config.
- 0.5.1
    - Updated the readme...
- 0.5.0
    - New skin 'Famed' added based off of Bayo's appearance in Bayonetta 2. Comes with VFX and a new voiceline for emote 1

        - Jump-cancellable moves now properly check to see if Bayo has any mid-air jumps remaining

    - Stat Nerfs :):
        - Base Health: 160 -> 110

     - Fixed bug that allowed Bayonetta to keep looping punish attacks on the same downed enemy
     - Added LordVGames' attack speed fix as a dependency because I hate player autonomy
- 0.4.1
    - Now doing the skindef optimization thingy
    - The punish prompt when getting close to an enemy no longer appears if Bayonetta is in the middle of another skill
        - Having the prompt appear in this scenario lead to a bug that allowed Bayonetta to infinatley activate interactable items such as fireworks
        - I will add a more elegant way of alerting the player when an enemy is punishable eventually
    - ABK's shooting state (state from holding m2 down after ABK) has been adjusted in order to flow better:
        - The shooting state itself has been shortened, but Bayonetta will now shoot during the main ABK state as long as the m2 button is held down
        - The bullets from the shooting state now juggle nearby enemies
    - Bayonetta's guns are now hidden during some of her taunts
- 0.4.0

    - The 'Strut' emote now automatically moves bayonetta forward

    - Changed item interaction with brainstalks, the braintalks buff will now only just remove all instance of WT cooldown when activated
    - Changed damage values:
        - Bullet arts punches: 300% -> 200%
            - Did you know that the first four punches of bullet arts were dealing twice the amount of damage that was listed in the skill def? Because I didn't
        - Bullet arts flurry attack: 135% -> 165%
        - Breakdance: 150% -> 120%
        - Heel Tornado: 200% -> 150%
        - Full Moon Shoot finisher: 125% -> 100%
