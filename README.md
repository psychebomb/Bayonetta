# Bayonetta Survivor Mod
Adds Bayonetta from the Bayonetta series, a versatile melee-ranged hybrid character able to weave in and out of danger in order to dish out high damage.

Multiplayer Compatible! (from what I've tested)

## Skills
### Primary: Bullet Arts
<img src="https://github.com/psychebomb/Bayonetta/blob/master/uploadthings/texM1.png?raw=true"/>

Perform a 5 hit punch sequence, dealing 150% damage for the first four hits. The last hit is a flurry attack that deals 135% damage each hit and summons a wicked weave when released, dealing 1400% damage. Bayonetta will also continuously fire her guns during the sequence, each shot dealing 50% damage.
If dodge is used during this sequence, Bayonetta will pick up the sequence where she left off as long as M1 is still held. Additionally, using this move against airborne enemies will juggle them, stunning them and knocking them upwards.

#### Secondary: Umbran Techniques

Perform a variety of different moves depending on movement inputs and whether or not Bayonetta is grounded.

#### Utility: Dodge
<img src="https://github.com/psychebomb/Bayonetta/blob/master/uploadthings/texUtility.png?raw=true"/>

Dodge a short distance, gaining brief invincibility and 100 armor. If you are hit during the invincibility, activate **Witch Time.**

While in Witch Time, Gain 350 armor. Enemies and projectiles near Bayonetta are greatly slowed, and moves that normally only launch lighter enemies will now launch all non-boss enemies. Enemies will also have their gravity altered, allowing for new followups.

### Special: Tetsuzanko/Heel Stomp
<img src="https://github.com/psychebomb/Bayonetta/blob/master/uploadthings/texSpecial.png?raw=true"/>

Lock onto enemies and use primary or secondary buttons to summon a wicked weave at their location, dealing 1200% damage.

## Other Interactions
Bayonetta has special interactions with items that reduce cooldowns:
- Bandolier: If Witch Time is active, gain an additional 4 seconds when picking up an ammo pack. If Bayonetta has the Witch Time cooldown debuff, remove the debuff upon picking up an ammo pack.
- Brainstalks: The buff from brainstalks activates its own Witch Time effect independent of regular Witch Time. This instance of Witch Time has no cooldown.
- Hardlight Afterburner: Adds 3 seconds to Witch Time's duration.
- Alien Head: Reduces Witch Time's cooldown by 25%
- Light Flux Pauldron: Reduces Witch Time's cooldown by 50%
- Purity: Removes 2 seconds of Witch Time's cooldown.

## Known Issues
